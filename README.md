# Training
Train a skill using `!train <skill>`. The following skills can be trained:
- atk
- def
- str
- magic
- ranged
- crafting
- woodcutting
- mining
- fishing
- farming
- sailing

You can also train atk, def, and str simultaneously using `!train all`.

# Crafting Overview
Training the Crafting skill unlocks your ability to craft powerful weapons, armor, and other accessories. In order to train this skill, you must have wood and/or ore available.

## Preparing to Train Crafting
You'll want a good supply of wood and ore before you begin training. As your Crafting level increases, the amount of wood and ore consumed during training also increases. For example, before reaching Crafting 20, only 1 wood and 1 ore are consumed every 2 seconds, while Crafting 90-99 requires 9 wood and 9 ore every 2 seconds.

#### Gathering Required Resources

Training the Mining and Woodcutting skills allows your character to gather these materials. The higher your skill level, the more resources your character can gather while training these professions, **and the more resources you receive from Raid Bosses.**
##### Mining Skill for Ore
```
!train mining
```
##### Woodcutting Skill for Wood
```
!train woodcutting
```

#### Resource Gathering Tips
* You should **always** join in on the fight with any Raid Bosses. No matter how you perform in the raid, you will still receive a lot of wood and ore if the boss is defeated.
* Consider training Woodcutting and Mining to at least 20-25 in order to dramatically increase the amount of resources you get from Raid Bosses.

## How to Train Crafting
When you have wood and ore on hand, you can begin training the Crafting skill.
```
!train crafting
```



#### Crafting Training Tips
* While you can train with only wood or only ore on hand, you'll train twice as fast if you have both resources available.
* The most powerful craftable items currently require a Crafting level of 99, but you can train up to 170.

# Crafting Items
You must be at the crafting table in order to craft items. You can do this by telling your character to train crafting.
```
!train crafting
```
**Important:** The game will attempt to create the most powerful item for which you meet all the requirements. For example, with Crafting 99 and Attack 1, crafting a weapon would only yield an Iron 2-Handed Sword. Make sure you meet the stat requirements.

To check your character stats without waiting for the game to cycle to your character, you can use:
```
!stats
```

*Note:* If you meet the stat requirements but don't have enough Ore and/or Wood, then you'll receive a warning. You don't have to worry about it crafting a less powerful item because you ran out of resources.

To check the amount of resources on hand, including wood and ore, without waiting for the game to cycle to your character, you can use:
```
!res
```
